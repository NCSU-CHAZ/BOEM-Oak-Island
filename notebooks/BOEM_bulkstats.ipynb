This is the second notebook in detailing specifically the processes and data from the bulk_stats _Sig1k.py script."

    "The bulk statistics are stored in h5 files like the other processed data files. The main difference for the bulk statistics, is that the groups that the processed data are stored in have been merged for the bulk statistics. This is possible since the bulk statistics are returned for every hour of sampling, so instead of the 14,400 samples per hour across multiple data fields we instead are left with just one averaged value per hour for each data field."
